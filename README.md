# Pacman Simulator

This application is a simulation of Pacman moving on a 5 x 5 grid. Pacman is free to roam around the grid, but is constrained to the parameters of the grid.

This project is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and uses [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/). I chose this approach as I think it gives a good indication of what I see as the day to day tasks of a Frontend Developer within IE.

## How to use

Set Pacman's initial position by setting the X, Y and Facing coordinates using the dropdown selectors.

You are then free to move Pacman around the grid by clicking the `Move` button, and changing their direction by clicking the `Left` and `Right` buttons.

Pacman's current position is tracked in the output.

You can update Pacman's starting position at any time by selecting new X, Y and Facing coordinates using the dropdown selectors.

## Testing

This application is tested using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
